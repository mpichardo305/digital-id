# Smart Redirection System - Developer Notes

## What We've Implemented

We've created an intelligent onboarding flow system that automatically directs users to the correct stage of their onboarding journey. Here's what it does:

1. **User Status Tracking**: The system queries the database to check what stage of onboarding the user has completed (stored in the `onboarding_step` field in the users table).

2. **Smart Redirection**: Based on the user's current progress, the system automatically redirects them to the appropriate page:
   - New users → Step 2 (upload photo & ID)
   - Users who completed Step 2 → Step 3 (processing screen)
   - Users who completed Step 3 → Congrats page
   - Users who completed all steps → Dashboard

3. **Seamless User Experience**: This prevents users from having to remember where they left off and ensures they always continue from the right point in their journey.

4. **Flexible Implementation**:
   - We've created a reusable `CheckStatusButton` component that can be placed anywhere in the UI
   - We've also set up server-side redirects for direct URL access to ensure consistent flow

## Technical Implementation

- Created a dedicated API route (`/api/check-status`) that queries the Supabase database
- Implemented a reusable React component (`CheckStatusButton`) that can be styled to match any design
- Set up middleware redirects for handling direct URL navigation
- Added comprehensive error handling to ensure users don't get stuck

## Benefits for User Experience

- Users always know where they are in the process
- Prevents confusion from seeing screens out of order
- Supports users who might close the app and return later
- Creates a guided, step-by-step experience that feels polished

This system creates a more intuitive flow through the digital ID creation process and prevents users from getting lost or confused about what they need to do next.
